# AlloGen

AlloGen is a Python library aimed at employing generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models for Alloy Design. Specifically, you can use the tools in this library to generate your own dataset and find the best compositions with your desired properties.

## Features

AlloGen provides the following features:

*Generation of alloy compositions with desired properties
*Training of generative models using custom datasets
*Calculation of materials properties from alloy compositions
*Integration with other Python libraries for machine learning and materials science

## Installation

To use AlloGen, import the necessary modules and functions from the library:

```python
pip install AlloGen

```
